And modified by me

Changes so far.
 - Flies removed.
 - Network code removed (need complete refactor).
 - Level builder removed.

This is a game for the whole family. You play cute fluffy little bunnies and
hop on each other's heads.

At the beginning you are in the menu, where you have to let each active players
jump over the tree trunk to enter the play area, and then walk to the right.
You will then enter the arena. The aim is to jump on the other bunnies' heads…

Jump 'n Bump was originally a DOS game by Brainchild Design, which was open
sourced under the GPL license and ported to SDL, and then SDL2.

## Controls

The controls are keyboard layout-independent, which means that regardless of
the layout that you are using (e.g. AZERTY or Dvorak), they are located as if
it were QWERTY.

The controls on a **QWERTY** keyboard are:

- A, W, D to steer Dot
- ←, ↑, → to steer Jiffy
- J, I, L to steer Fizz
- 4, 8, 6 to steer Mijji (on the numeric pad)

You can also use joysticks (main axis and button 1 will be used).

- F10 toggles fullscreen
- ESC ends the game
- F12 closes the game and quits

## Extra levels

Additional levels are available on the website of
[Brainchild Design](http://www.brainchilddesign.com/games/jumpnbump/levels/levels1.html).
You can launch them with `jumpnbump -dat levelname.dat`.
